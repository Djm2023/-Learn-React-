ðŸ‘‰ Library : It is a collection of pre-written code that programmers can use to optimize their tasks ,also they provide reusable chunks of code that developers can use to create applications quickly and easily.

Libraries focus on solving a specific problem within an area of development.

ðŸ‘‰ Framework : Frameworks are collections of coded components that are already configured to work together. Frameworks generally include a preset architecture or design that developers must work within.
Frameworks often focus on functioning as an all-in-one solution for a specific methodology.
